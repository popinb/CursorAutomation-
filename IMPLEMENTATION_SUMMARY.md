## 🎯 Key Features Implemented

### 1. Custom GPT Instructions Simulation
The system replicates the "Instructions" field from Custom GPT:

```python
self.custom_instructions = """
You are an expert AI evaluator designed to assess the quality of responses from AI systems.
Your role is to act as an impartial judge, providing detailed analysis and scoring.

CORE RESPONSIBILITIES:
1. Evaluate responses for accuracy, relevance, and quality
2. Provide detailed reasoning for your assessments
3. Score responses on a scale of 0-5
4. Identify strengths and areas for improvement
...
"""
```

### 2. Knowledge Source Integration
Simulates uploaded knowledge files with contextual retrieval:

```python
def get_context(self, query: str = "") -> str:
    """Get relevant context from knowledge base."""
    return self.knowledge_content
```

### 3. LLM-as-a-Judge Methodology
Implements sophisticated evaluation logic:
- Chain-of-thought reasoning before scoring
- Structured output parsing
- Consistent evaluation criteria
- Error handling and fallback mechanisms

### 4. OpenAI Evals Compatibility
Full integration with the evals framework:
- Standard sample format (`EvalSample` dataclass)
- Metrics calculation and reporting
- Batch processing capabilities
- YAML configuration support

### 5. Comprehensive Reporting
Detailed evaluation reports including:
- Overall metrics (pass rate, average score)
- Score distribution analysis
- Individual sample results with reasoning
- Category-based performance breakdown

## 🔄 How It Works

### Evaluation Flow
1. **Load Configuration**: Read YAML config and knowledge sources
2. **Initialize Judge**: Set up Custom GPT instructions and knowledge base
3. **Process Samples**: Load evaluation data from JSONL files
4. **Execute Evaluation**: Call LLM judge for each sample with context
5. **Parse Results**: Extract scores and reasoning from judge responses
6. **Generate Report**: Compile comprehensive evaluation metrics

### Sample Evaluation Process
```python
async def evaluate_response(self, original_prompt, response_to_evaluate, expected_answer):
    # Get knowledge base context
    context = self.knowledge_base.get_context()
    
    # Construct evaluation prompt with instructions + context
    evaluation_prompt = self._construct_evaluation_prompt(...)
    
    # Call OpenAI API for judgment
    response = await self._call_openai_api(evaluation_prompt)
    
    # Parse structured output (reasoning, score, pass/fail)
    return self._parse_evaluation_response(response)
```

## 📊 Evaluation Categories Supported

The implementation includes diverse sample types:

1. **Factual Questions** - Geography, history, basic facts
2. **Mathematical Problems** - Arithmetic, word problems
3. **Creative Tasks** - Poetry, storytelling, creative writing
4. **Scientific Explanations** - Physics, chemistry, biology concepts
5. **Customer Service** - Policy explanations, helpful responses
6. **Educational Content** - Programming tutorials, learning materials
7. **Instructional Guides** - How-to content, step-by-step instructions
8. **Informational Responses** - Travel advice, recommendations
9. **Health & Wellness** - Exercise benefits, wellness advice
10. **Financial Education** - Investment concepts, financial literacy

## 🛠️ Customization Points

### 1. Knowledge Sources
```python
# Replace simulated content with actual file loading
def _load_knowledge_sources(self) -> str:
    knowledge_content = ""
    for source in self.knowledge_sources:
        with open(source, 'r') as f:
            knowledge_content += f.read() + "\n\n"
    return knowledge_content
```

### 2. Evaluation Criteria
```python
# Modify instructions for domain-specific evaluation
self.custom_instructions = """
DOMAIN-SPECIFIC CRITERIA:
- Medical safety for health-related content
- Code security for programming responses
- Legal compliance for financial advice
"""
```

### 3. Scoring Systems
```python
# Adapt scoring scale (e.g., 1-10 instead of 0-5)
def _parse_evaluation_response(self, response: str):
    # Custom parsing logic for different scales
    pass
```

## 📈 Performance Characteristics

### Strengths
- **High Flexibility**: Easily adaptable to different evaluation scenarios
- **Consistent Scoring**: LLM judge provides reliable, repeatable evaluations

from custom_gpt_judge_eval import CustomGPTEvaluator

evaluator = CustomGPTEvaluator(api_key="...", model="gpt-4")
results = await evaluator.evaluate_samples(samples)
```

### 4. Custom Pipeline Integration
```python
# Integrate into existing ML pipelines
def evaluate_model_outputs(model_responses):
    samples = convert_to_eval_samples(model_responses)
    results = await evaluator.evaluate_samples(samples)
    return generate_metrics(results)
