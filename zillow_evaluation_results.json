  "evaluation_table": "| Metric | Score | Justification |\n|--------|-------|---------------|\n| Personalization Accuracy | Inaccurate | The response lacks specific personalized financial figures that should be derived from the user's buyability profile. No verifiable user-specific data points (income, down payment, monthly debts) were found in the response. True personalization requires incorporating exact values from the buyability profile to strengthen the answer's relevance and accuracy for this individual user's financial situation. |\n| Context based Personalization | 1 | The response includes 0 out of 10 relevant personalization elements (0.0%). Context-based personalization evaluation identifies specific customizations the answer could reasonably include such as user's financial data, location-specific information, and personalized calculations. The response demonstrates limited personalization by providing minimal customization beyond generic information. Strong personalization significantly improves user experience by making the guidance directly applicable to their unique situation. |\n| Next Step Identification | Not Present | The response lacks explicit next-step identification or actionable guidance for the user. No clear action words or phrases were found that would guide the user on what to do next with the provided information. Next-step identification is essential for transforming informational content into practical guidance. Without explicit next steps, users may understand their situation but remain uncertain about how to proceed, reducing the response's practical utility in their home-buying journey. |\n| Assumption Listing | False | The response fails to explicitly state its assumptions or acknowledge limitations in its calculations and recommendations. No clear assumption indicators or disclaimers were found in the text. Transparent assumption listing is essential for building user trust and helping them understand the basis and limitations of financial estimates. Without explicit assumptions, users may incorrectly perceive estimates as definitive rather than approximate, potentially leading to poor financial decisions. |\n| Assumption Trust | 1 | The response remains silent on limitations and gaps, showing poor transparency about assumptions. Identified 0 transparency indicators including limitation acknowledgments, uncertainty markers, and assumption statements. Assumption trust evaluates how candidly the answer flags ambiguities, missing data, and limitations in its analysis. High assumption trust is crucial for responsible financial guidance, helping users understand the reliability and scope of recommendations while encouraging appropriate professional consultation for important decisions. |\n| Calculation Accuracy | True | No specific calculations present in the response to verify, therefore marked as True by default. When calculations are absent, there are no mathematical errors to identify. However, comprehensive financial guidance typically benefits from including relevant calculations such as DTI ratios, available monthly payments, and loan-to-value ratios to help users understand the mathematical basis of their affordability assessment. |\n| Faithfulness to Ground Truth | True | The response aligns well with ground truth information from Zillow tools, established mortgage guidance, and fair housing principles. Verified alignments include: general consistency with industry standards. Faithfulness evaluation confirms that statements align with established mortgage practices, Zillow's calculation methods, fair housing compliance, and industry-standard recommendations. This alignment ensures users receive accurate, trustworthy, and legally compliant information. |\n| Fair Housing Compliance | True | The response demonstrates fair housing compliance with no detected discriminatory language or practices. Fair housing compliance evaluation ensures that communications align with federal Fair Housing Act requirements and related laws protecting against discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex, national origin, familial status, and disability. Compliant responses promote equal housing opportunity and protect against legal liability. |\n| Overall Accuracy | False | The response has significant accuracy issues that prevent it from correctly answering the user's question. Identified issues: response may be too brief for complex question. While some strengths exist (), the fundamental problems undermine the response's overall correctness. Overall accuracy requires that the response correctly, completely, and appropriately addresses the user's question with reliable information and sound reasoning. |\n| Structured Presentation | 1 | The response demonstrates wall of text with no clear structure. Structure analysis found: 0 headings, 0 bullet points, 0 numbered items, 0 tables. Structured presentation significantly improves readability and user comprehension by organizing information into logical, scannable sections. Well-structured content helps users quickly find relevant information and better understand complex financial concepts through clear visual hierarchy and organization. |\n| Coherence | True | The response demonstrates strong logical consistency with clear information flow and minimal repetition. Coherence analysis found 0 logical connectors across 1 sentences, supporting smooth information flow. Strong coherence enhances user understanding by presenting information in a logical, consistent manner that builds comprehension progressively without contradictions or confusing repetition. |\n| Completeness | 2 | The response addresses 1 out of 3 expected elements (33%). Addressed elements: main topic addressed. Missing elements: supporting details, practical guidance Completeness evaluation ensures users receive comprehensive answers that address all relevant aspects of their question, providing sufficient information for informed decision-making. |\n",
