================================================================================

| Metric | Score | Justification |
|--------|-------|---------------|
| Personalization Accuracy | Inaccurate | The personalization fails to adequately improve the answer quality. Chain-of-thought analysis: Buyability number present: True; Monthly payment referenced: False; Interest rate mentioned: False; User-specific data utilized: False. Missing relevant parameters: None identified. The response lacks sufficient user-specific figures derived from the buyability profile data such as specific BuyAbility amounts or projected monthly payments. The personalization parameters either don't make sense in context or critical user-specific elements are omitted that would have significantly improved the answer's relevance and actionability. |
| Context based Personalization | 1 | The response demonstrates context-based personalization scoring 1 out of 5. Analysis shows 0 out of 15 relevant personalization elements present (0.0%). Present customizations include: none identified. Missing opportunities: debt-to-income ratio, credit score range, projected monthly payment, down payment amount, monthly debt obligations, location-specific factors, recommended price range, closing cost estimates, specific buyability amount, property tax estimates, insurance costs, loan terms personalization, PMI calculations, interest rate based on credit, user's annual income. Effective context-based personalization requires incorporating user-specific financial data, location factors, and personalized calculations that make the guidance directly applicable to their unique situation. Strong personalization significantly enhances user experience by providing tailored recommendations that address their specific financial circumstances and home-buying context. |
| Next Step Identification | Not Present | Next-step identification is not present in the response. The analysis shows no explicit action words or implicit guidance phrases that would direct the user toward specific next actions. The response lacks clear directional language such as 'apply', 'schedule', 'consult', 'get pre-approved', or even softer guidance like 'should consider' or 'next step'. Without explicit next-step identification, users may understand their financial situation but remain uncertain about how to proceed practically. This significantly reduces the response's utility in the home-buying journey, as users need actionable guidance to transform information into concrete progress toward their goals. |
| Assumption Listing | False | The response fails to clearly state assumptions or acknowledge limitations in its analysis and recommendations. No assumption indicators were found in the text such as 'assumes', 'based on estimates', 'limitations include', or explicit statements about assumptions made. Transparent assumption listing is fundamental for responsible financial guidance, as it helps users understand what underlying conditions or data points the analysis depends upon. Without clear assumption statements, users may incorrectly interpret provisional estimates as definitive recommendations, potentially leading to poor financial decisions. The absence of assumption transparency undermines the credibility and responsible nature of financial guidance. |
| Assumption Trust | 1 | The response demonstrates assumption trust scoring 1 out of 5 based on transparency and candor evaluation. Identified transparency indicators: none. Shortcoming callouts present: none. Total transparency elements found: 0. High assumption trust requires the response to appropriately acknowledge ambiguous or missing data, call out deficiencies in the analysis, and demonstrate candor about limitations. This evaluation focuses specifically on the user prompt context and available information rather than hypothetical errors. Transparent communication about assumptions and limitations is crucial for responsible financial guidance, helping users understand the reliability and scope of recommendations while encouraging appropriate professional consultation for important financial decisions. |
| Calculation Accuracy | True | No specific calculations are present in the response to verify, therefore marked as True by default. The absence of calculations means there are no mathematical errors to identify or validate against the buyability profile data. However, comprehensive financial guidance typically benefits from including relevant calculations such as debt-to-income ratios, monthly payment breakdowns, loan-to-value ratios, and affordability estimates. When calculations are included, they should be verified against inputs from the buyability profile including annual income, monthly debts, down payment amount, and credit score to ensure mathematical accuracy and consistency with the user's financial profile. |
| Faithfulness to Ground Truth | False | The response contains statements that do not align with ground truth information from Zillow tools and established guidance. Identified misalignments: general inconsistency with established practices. Faithfulness to ground truth requires that all statements align with documented Zillow methodologies, proven mortgage practices, and established industry standards to ensure users receive accurate and reliable guidance. |
| Overall Accuracy | False | The response has significant accuracy issues that prevent it from correctly answering the user's question. Identified fundamental problems: insufficient depth for question complexity. Question type analysis: affordability assessment. While some elements may be accurate in isolation, these fundamental issues undermine the response's overall correctness and utility. Overall accuracy requires that the response correctly, completely, and appropriately addresses the user's question with reliable information, sound reasoning, and sufficient depth to be genuinely helpful. The identified problems prevent the response from meeting these standards for effective user guidance in home affordability assessment. |
| Structured Presentation | 1 | The response demonstrates structured presentation scoring 1 out of 5. Structural analysis found: 0 headings, 0 bullet points, 0 numbered items, 0 table elements. Estimated structured content: 0.0%. The response presents as a wall of text with no clear organizational structure, making it difficult for users to scan and find relevant information quickly. Structured presentation significantly improves readability and user comprehension by organizing information into logical, scannable sections that help users quickly locate relevant information and better understand complex financial concepts through clear visual hierarchy. |
| Coherence | False | The response has coherence issues that affect logical consistency and readability. Identified problems: poor logical flow. The response contains 0 logical connectors across 1 sentences. Coherence problems can confuse users and undermine the credibility of the guidance by presenting contradictory information or excessive repetition that detracts from clear communication. |
| Completeness | 1 | The response demonstrates completeness scoring 1 out of 5, addressing 0 out of 6 expected sub-questions (0.0%). Addressed elements: . Missing elements: down payment assessment, credit score influence, monthly payment calculation, income consideration, location/market factors, debt impact analysis. Completeness evaluation ensures users receive comprehensive answers that address all relevant aspects of their question, providing sufficient information for informed decision-making. A complete response anticipates user needs and provides thorough coverage of the topic to minimize follow-up questions and maximize the value of the guidance provided. Higher completeness scores indicate that users receive more comprehensive information that better serves their home-buying decision process. |
| Fair Housing Classifier | True | The response demonstrates full compliance with fair housing requirements and shows no violations of federal Fair Housing Act protections. Analysis of the response against fair housing guidelines found no discriminatory language, practices, or guidance that would violate protections for race, color, religion, sex, national origin, familial status, disability, or other protected classes. The response promotes equal housing opportunity and avoids any language or recommendations that could be construed as discriminatory or steering based on protected characteristics. Fair housing compliance is essential for ensuring equal access to housing opportunities and protecting against legal liability while providing inclusive guidance that serves all users regardless of their protected class status. |
