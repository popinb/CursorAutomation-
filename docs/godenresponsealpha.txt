1. What factors and inputs were considered to calculate my Buyability? How does each impact the Buyability?
Your personalized BuyAbility estimate is $318,431, and it is calculated using the following inputs you provided.We leveraged real-time market conditions to determine a customized rate estimate :
Annual Income: $90,000
Monthly Debts: $200
Down Payment: $18,000
Credit Score Range: 660–719
Target Monthly Payment: $2,500
Location: Georgia
Interest rate estimate: 6.88%
Here's how each input impacts your BuyAbility:
1. Income and Debt-to-Income Ratio (DTI)
 Lenders typically recommend up to 36 % of your gross monthly income to go toward debts (for financial stability), including the mortgage. Based on your $90,000 annual income (or $7,500/month), this means up to $2,700/month could be available for all debt obligations. Subtracting your current $200/month debt leaves around $2,500/month for a potential mortgage payment, which aligns with your target
 (Only mention that it aligns with your Target, if the user entered the optional Target monthly payment).
2. Down Payment and Loan Amount
 You have saved $18,000 for a down payment. That amount influences how much you need to borrow and impacts the kind of loans available to you:
 • As low as 3 % down payment is generally the minimum required for most loans.
 • With $18,000, the maximum purchase price you could target is approximately $514,000 assuming a 3 % down payment.
 • However, for your BuyAbility to be $318,431, this down payment puts you above the minimum threshold, which slightly helps reduce your overall loan amount and thus your monthly payments.
3. Credit Score and Interest Rate
 Your credit score range of 660–719 places you in a good position to get a mortgage in most cases:
 • Higher scores (720+) could further improve your rate (6.88 %), reducing monthly payments and increasing BuyAbility.
4. Location: Georgia (Property Taxes & Insurance)
 BuyAbility also factors in location-based expenses like property taxes and homeowners insurance:
 • Georgia typically has an avg X % property tax rates, which is favorable.
 • Homeowners insurance, which is mandatory, is also location-sensitive and is included in the estimated monthly payment.
5. Mortgage Insurance (PMI)
 Because your down payment is less than 20 % of the home price, lenders will require Private Mortgage Insurance (PMI):
 • PMI adds an additional monthly cost and slightly reduces your BuyAbility.
 • However, once you reach 20 % equity, you may be able to remove PMI.

3. What’s included in the total monthly payment?
What’s Included in Your Target Monthly Payment?
Your target monthly payment of $2,500 reflects the full estimated cost of owning a home each month—not just the mortgage. Here’s how that total breaks down:
Breakdown of Your $2,500 Monthly Payment
• Principal & Interest: $1,975 This reflects the mortgage payment, based on a 30-year fixed loan at an interest rate of 6.880 %. It covers the amount borrowed (principal) and the cost of borrowing (interest).
• Property Taxes: $212 This is an estimate using the average property tax rate for the state you selected. Zillow applies this rate to your estimated home value to calculate monthly taxes.
• Homeowners Insurance: $106 This covers typical property insurance requirements for mortgage approval, providing financial protection against damage or loss.
<Only show PMI if the down payment is < 20 %, otherwise don’t show it>
• Private Mortgage Insurance (PMI): $207 Because your down payment is below 20 %, this monthly cost protects the lender in case of default. It’s common in low-down-payment loans.
Assumptions to Know
• HOA fees are not included in this estimate. If you’re considering a home with a homeowners association, that monthly cost would be additional.
• Property tax estimates use the average rate for your selected state, not county-specific rates.

4. Can I afford to buy a home right now, given my current financial situation, income, debts, and expenses?
Yes, based on your BuyAbility of $318,431, you can afford to buy a home in Georgia!
Your financial readiness aligns well with current market dynamics. With your BuyAbility at $318K, and DTI < 36 % (as recommended by experts for financial stability) you're in a strong position to shop for homes in many parts of Georgia, especially in suburban and rural regions.
Given the improving inventory and balanced market conditions, this is a promising time to take the next step toward homeownership. Many homes in the $250K–$350K range are becoming more accessible and well-aligned to your estimated budget.

5. How much should my down payment be? / What is the minimum down payment required for the home I want, and how does the down payment amount affect my affordability and monthly payment?
The minimum down payment depends on the type of loan and the home price you’re considering. Here's how it works and how it affects your affordability:
💵 Minimum Down Payment by Loan Type:
• Conventional Loan: Minimum 3–5 %
• FHA Loan: Minimum 3.5 %
• VA Loan (for veterans): 0 %
• Jumbo Loans (high-value homes): Typically 10–20 %
For example, if you're buying a $500,000 home:
 3 % down = $15,000 | 5 % down = $25,000 | 20 % down = $100,000
📊 How Down Payment Affects You:
• Lower down payment:
 ✅ Less upfront cash needed
 ❗ Higher monthly payments
 ❗ Mortgage insurance may apply (adds cost)
• Higher down payment:
 ✅ Smaller loan amount = lower monthly payments
 ✅ Avoid mortgage insurance (if 20 % + down)
 ✅ Increases your Buyability score and approval chances
