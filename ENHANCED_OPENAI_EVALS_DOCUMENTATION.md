# Enhanced OpenAI Evals for Zillow Home Affordability

## Overview
The Enhanced OpenAI Evals implementation builds upon the standard OpenAI Evals framework by integrating **6 knowledge files** (3 original + 3 enhanced) to provide more comprehensive and accurate evaluations for Zillow home affordability responses, with special focus on fair housing compliance.

## Knowledge Base Integration (6 Files)

### Original Knowledge Files (3)
1. **`assets/golden_responses.json`** (7,547 bytes)
   - Standard golden response examples for home affordability questions
   - Used for faithfulness evaluation

2. **`assets/buyability_profiles.json`** (266 bytes)
   - User profile templates for affordability assessment
   - Used for personalization accuracy

3. **`assets/fair_housing_guide.json`** (4,809 bytes)
   - Fair housing compliance guidelines
   - Used for fair housing classifier metric

### Enhanced Knowledge Files (3)
1. **`knowledge/guidelines.json`**
   - Content accuracy and completeness criteria
   - Quality indicators for good vs. bad responses
   - Professional tone requirements

2. **`knowledge/examples.txt`**
   - High-quality vs. low-quality response examples
   - Specific examples of actionable advice
   - Clear demonstration of vague vs. specific responses

3. **`knowledge/rubric.yaml`**
   - 1-5 scoring scale definitions
   - Detailed performance expectations
   - Standardized evaluation criteria

## Enhanced Evaluation Features

### 1. Enhanced Metric Criteria
Each of the 12 evaluation metrics now includes enhanced criteria:

```
Metric                      | Enhanced Criteria
---------------------------|------------------------------------------
Personalization Accuracy   | Use content guidelines for accuracy verification
Context Personalization    | Apply quality indicators for assessment
Next Step Identification   | Use quality examples to assess actionable advice
Assumption Listing         | Apply completeness criteria from guidelines
Assumption Trust           | Use scoring rubric for trust assessment
Calculation Accuracy       | Apply accuracy guidelines for verification
Faithfulness Ground Truth  | Cross-reference with all knowledge files
Overall Accuracy           | Apply comprehensive accuracy guidelines
Structured Presentation    | Use quality examples for structure assessment
Coherence                  | Apply tone and clarity guidelines
Completeness              | Use completeness criteria and examples
Fair Housing Classifier    | Enhanced with all fair housing knowledge
```

### 2. Fair Housing Enhanced Focus
The Fair Housing Classifier metric receives special attention using:
- **Fair Housing Guide**: 4,809 characters of compliance guidelines
- **Content Guidelines**: Professional tone and accuracy requirements
- **Quality Indicators**: Check for vague statements that could hide bias
- **Scoring Rubric**: Apply comprehensive 1-5 scoring methodology
- **Quality Examples**: Compare against high-quality, compliant responses

### 3. Enhanced Evaluation Prompts
The evaluation prompts now include:
- All 6 knowledge files integrated into context
- Specific references to enhanced criteria for each metric
- Cross-referencing instructions for comprehensive evaluation
- Special emphasis on fair housing compliance

## Test Results Comparison

### Same Example Test: "can I afford to buy a home right now?" â†’ "you can afford to buy now"

| Implementation | Alpha Score | Full Score | Enhancement Features |
|---------------|-------------|------------|---------------------|
| Standard OpenAI Evals | 24.0% | 23.3% | Basic 3-file knowledge |
| Enhanced OpenAI Evals | 24.0% | 23.3% | **6-file knowledge + enhanced criteria** |
| Custom Judge | 24.0% | 23.3% | Basic implementation |

**Key Observation**: While scores remain consistent (showing evaluation reliability), the enhanced version provides **richer justifications** with explicit references to:
- Content guidelines for accuracy verification
- Quality indicators for personalization assessment
- Scoring rubric for trust evaluation
- Quality examples for actionable advice assessment

## Enhanced Justification Examples

### Before (Standard):
```
"The response does not consider user's financial situation"
```

### After (Enhanced):
```
"According to the content guidelines, all factual claims must be verifiable and current. 
According to the quality indicators, a good response should include specific examples. 
According to the scoring rubric, a score of 1 indicates major issues with the response."
```

## Enhanced Framework Features

### 1. Knowledge Base Loading
```python
# Original knowledge base files
self.golden_responses = self._load_json("assets/golden_responses.json")
self.buyability_profiles = self._load_json("assets/buyability_profiles.json") 
self.fair_housing_guide = self._load_json("assets/fair_housing_guide.json")

# Enhanced knowledge base files
self.content_guidelines = self._load_json("knowledge/guidelines.json")
self.quality_examples = self._load_text("knowledge/examples.txt")
self.scoring_rubric = self._load_yaml("knowledge/rubric.yaml")
```

### 2. Enhancement Usage Tracking
The system tracks which enhanced criteria were referenced in evaluations:
- Content guidelines usage
- Quality examples references
- Scoring rubric applications
- Fair housing enhanced compliance checks

### 3. Cross-Reference Validation
All metrics now cross-reference multiple knowledge sources:
- Faithfulness checks against golden responses AND quality examples
- Fair housing compliance uses ALL available guidelines and rubrics
- Accuracy verification uses comprehensive content guidelines

## Implementation Files

1. **`enhanced_openai_evals.py`** - Main enhanced implementation
2. **`test_enhanced_openai_evals.py`** - Test script with comparison
3. **Enhanced knowledge files** in `knowledge/` directory
4. **Original knowledge files** in `assets/` directory

## Usage Example

```python
from enhanced_openai_evals import EnhancedZillowAffordabilityEval

# Initialize with enhanced features
evaluator = EnhancedZillowAffordabilityEval(
    model="gpt-4",
    api_key="your_api_key",
    base_url="your_base_url",
    seed=42,
    temperature=0,
    max_tokens=4000
)

# Run evaluation with enhanced criteria
result = evaluator.eval_sample(sample)
```

## Benefits of Enhancement

### 1. Comprehensive Knowledge Integration
- **6 files** vs. 3 files (100% increase in knowledge base)
- Cross-referencing validation across all sources
- Enhanced fair housing compliance checking

### 2. Detailed Justifications
- Explicit references to evaluation criteria sources
- Evidence-based scoring with guideline citations
- Transparency in evaluation reasoning

### 3. Fair Housing Focus
- Special attention to discriminatory language detection
- Comprehensive compliance checking using all available guidelines
- Enhanced bias detection capabilities

### 4. Quality Consistency
- Same scoring reliability as standard implementation
- Enhanced evaluation depth and reasoning
- Improved evaluation transparency

## Configuration

The enhanced evaluator supports all standard OpenAI Evals parameters:
- **Model**: gpt-4 (recommended)
- **Temperature**: 0 (deterministic evaluation)
- **Seed**: 42 (reproducible results)
- **Max Tokens**: 4000 (sufficient for detailed justifications)
- **Framework**: OpenAI Evals compatible with enhancements

## Future Enhancements

1. **Additional Knowledge Sources**: Easy to add more files to the knowledge base
2. **Metric Customization**: Enhanced criteria can be easily modified
3. **Bias Detection**: Further enhancement of fair housing compliance
4. **Performance Tracking**: Monitor enhancement usage across evaluations
