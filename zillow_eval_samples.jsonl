{"question": "How much house can I afford?", "candidate_answer": "Based on your income of $85,000 annually and current debts of $800 monthly, with a 20% down payment, you could afford a home in the $300,000-$350,000 range. This assumes a 30-year mortgage at current rates. I recommend getting pre-approved to confirm this estimate and exploring properties in this price range.", "user_profile": {"annual_income": 85000, "monthly_debts": 800, "down_payment": 60000, "credit_score": 750}}

{"question": "Should I buy or rent?", "candidate_answer": "Given your financial situation with $95,000 annual income and $25,000 saved for a down payment, buying could be a good option. Your debt-to-income ratio appears manageable. However, consider factors like job stability, local market conditions, and your long-term plans. Renting offers flexibility while buying builds equity. I'd suggest speaking with a financial advisor and getting pre-approved to understand your exact buying power before making this important decision.", "user_profile": {"annual_income": 95000, "monthly_debts": 900, "down_payment": 25000, "credit_score": 740}}
