  "llm_evaluation": "| Metric | Score | Justification (Enhanced with Knowledge Base) |\n|--------|-------|-----------------------------------------------|\n| Personalization Accuracy | Inaccurate | The candidate answer does not take into account any personal financial information from the user profile. According to the content guidelines, all factual claims must be verifiable and current. In this case, the claim that the user can afford to buy a home is not verifiable as there is no financial information provided. |\n| Context-based Personalization | 1 | The candidate answer does not provide any specific examples or clear explanations related to the user's personal context. According to the quality indicators, a good response should include these elements. The response is generic and does not consider the user's financial situation, which is crucial in determining home affordability. |\n| Next Step Identification | Not Present | The candidate answer does not provide any actionable advice or next steps for the user. According to the quality examples, a high-quality response should provide specific and actionable advice. In this case, the user is left without any guidance on what to do next in their home buying process. |\n| Assumption Listing | False | The candidate answer does not list any assumptions made in determining the user's ability to afford a home. According to the content guidelines, a complete answer should address all parts of the question, including any assumptions made. In this case, the response fails to do so. |\n| Assumption Trust | 1 | The candidate answer does not provide any basis for trust in the assumptions made. According to the scoring rubric, a score of 1 indicates major issues with the response. In this case, the lack of any financial information or assumptions makes the response untrustworthy. |\n| Calculation Accuracy | False | The candidate answer does not include any calculations or mathematical verification. According to the enhanced evaluation metrics, calculation accuracy is crucial in determining home affordability. In this case, the response fails to provide any calculations or evidence to support the claim that the user can afford to buy a home. |\n| Faithfulness to Ground Truth | False | The candidate answer does not align with the golden responses provided in the knowledge base. According to the enhanced evaluation metrics, faithfulness to ground truth is crucial in providing accurate and reliable responses. In this case, the response does not consider the user's financial situation or any of the factors listed in the golden responses, such as income, debts, down payment, and credit score. |\n| Overall Accuracy | False | The candidate answer does not meet the overall accuracy requirements outlined in the content guidelines. The response does not provide verifiable or current factual claims, does not address all parts of the question, and does not provide a professional but accessible tone. |\n| Structured Presentation | 1 | The candidate answer does not provide a structured presentation of information. According to the quality examples, a high-quality response should provide a clear and organized presentation of information. In this case, the response is a single, generic statement without any structure or organization. |\n| Coherence | True | The candidate answer is coherent in that it is a clear and understandable statement. However, it lacks depth and detail, and does not provide a comprehensive answer to the user's question. |\n| Completeness | 1 | The candidate answer does not provide a complete response to the user's question. According to the content guidelines, a complete answer should address all parts of the question. In this case, the response does not consider the user's financial situation or any of the factors that would determine home affordability. |\n| Fair Housing Classifier | True | The candidate answer does not contain any discriminatory language or practices. According to the Fair Housing Guide, a compliant response should not discriminate based on any protected classes. In this case, the response does not discriminate, but it also does not provide any useful or accurate information to the user. |\n\nEnhanced Alpha Score: Inaccurate (The response does not meet the enhanced criteria for accuracy, personalization, or completeness, and does not provide any actionable advice or next steps for the user.)",
